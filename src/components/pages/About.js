      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I am an aspiring web developer who loves to work on logic puzzles. My passions include photography and cameras and spend my free time taking picures of nature and people. I also enjoy all things related to metal and have a deep appreciation of their craftsmanship. (i.e.pocket knives, watches, computers, etc.) My logical personality and visual acuity for problems provide me with a unique perspective on web development.
